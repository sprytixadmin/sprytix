We are a team of researchers who are passionate about Carbon Intelligence. We spend our time in understanding the sources of CO2 emissions and the need for accurate and reliable data to track them. We understand the importance of using standardized protocols and metrics to compare emissions data across regions and countries. The role of carbon data in informing policy decisions such as setting emissions reduction targets and monitoring progress towards net-zero goals is a part of our mission. We target carbon data to identify areas where there is an impact on net zero goals such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, carbon capture and storage.\n\n\n\n\nNone of the things that we do comes without challenges in collecting and using carbon datasets, including data quality, data access, and data privacy. We have learned to overcome some of the challenges and made headway towards attaining our mission. The role of technology has been improving carbon data collection and analysis, such as the use of business intelligence and cloud-based data platforms. Our research platform facilitates augmenting of business intelligence insights and embedding these in research documents. Doing so enables researchers to conduct exploratory data analysis and publish their research on carbon insights."

It is a critical step towards mitigating the impacts of climate change. Understanding the science behind Mission Net Zero is of prime importance. The benefits of transitioning to a net-zero economy, including improved air quality, energy security, and job creation are limitless.\nAll the governments, businesses, and individuals need to participate collectively in achieving Mission Net Zero and support the policies and technologies that can help. There are numerous challenges and obstacles in reaching net-zero emissions. They can be overcome by participating together. Various countries, cities, and companies have been making progress and initiatives being taken by towards achieving net-zero emissions.\nThe impact of Mission Net Zero on different sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and energy production is huge. The interlinkages between Mission Net Zero and sustainable development goals, such as poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth has been established, but yet to be fully realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Development\n\nGoal# 13 - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\n\n\n\nFocus on Sustainability Development Goal# 13 - Climate Action\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Sustainability Development Goal# 13?\n\nUnited Nations Sustainability Development Goal #13, titled “Climate Action,” represents a pivotal global effort to address the escalating threats posed by climate change. With a primary focus on mitigating carbon emissions and fostering resilience to climate-related hazards, this goal emphasizes the imperative for urgent and collective action from nations, communities, and industries worldwide. At its core, Goal #13 aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with endeavors to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nCentral to achieving Goal #13 is the implementation of comprehensive climate policies, investments in renewable energy infrastructure, and the adoption of sustainable practices across sectors. By promoting sustainable land use, reducing emissions from industries and transportation, and enhancing climate resilience in vulnerable regions, nations can contribute significantly to curbing climate change impacts and safeguarding the planet’s ecosystems and biodiversity. Furthermore, Goal #13 underscores the critical need for international cooperation and partnerships to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and accelerate progress towards a sustainable and climate-resilient future for all. Through concerted efforts to address climate change, Goal #13 aims to pave the way for a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world for present and future generations."

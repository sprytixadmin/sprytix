Mission Net Zero is a movement or a goal aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level where they are balanced by removals, leading to net zero emissions. It is a critical step towards mitigating the impacts of climate change. Understanding the science behind Mission Net Zero is of prime importance. The benefits of transitioning to a net-zero economy, including improved air quality, energy security, and job creation are limitless. All the governments, businesses, and individuals need to participate collectively in achieving Mission Net Zero and support the policies and technologies that can help. There are numerous challenges and obstacles in reaching net-zero emissions. They can be overcome by participating together. Various countries, cities, and companies have been making progress and initiatives being taken by towards achieving net-zero emissions. The impact of Mission Net Zero on different sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and energy production is huge. The interlinkages between Mission Net Zero and sustainable development goals, such as poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth has been established, but yet to be fully realized.

Carbon data-based research is a crucial aspect of controlling CO2 emissions and achieving Mission Net Zero. We are a team of researchers who are passionate about Carbon based data. We spend our time in understanding the sources of CO2 emissions and the need for accurate and reliable data to track them. Data Science methods and techniques are used to collect and analyze carbon data, including remote sensing, ground-based measurements, and computer modeling. We understand the importance of using standardized protocols and metrics to compare emissions data across regions and countries. The role of carbon data in informing policy decisions, such as setting emissions reduction targets and monitoring progress towards net-zero goals is a part of our mission. We target carbon data to identify areas where emissions can be reduced, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage.

None of the things that we do comes without challenges in collecting and using carbon data, including data quality, data access, and data privacy. We have learned to overcome some of the challenges and made headways towards attaining our mission. The role of technology in improving carbon data collection and analysis, such as the use of machine learning algorithms and cloud-based data platforms. Our Artificial Intelligence based research platform enables the potential for carbon data to be utilized for sustainability reporting and carbon market development.
